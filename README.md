# ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence Labs â€” IC-6200

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains a collection of laboratory exercises developed for the course IC6200 â€” Artificial Intelligence at Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Costa Rica. The labs cover a wide range of fundamental AI concepts, algorithms, and implementation strategies using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

---

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered

The repository includes labs related to:

- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Error Rate Analysis
- Matrix Operations and Vectorization
- Searching Algorithms
- Perceptrons and Neural Networks (forward and backward propagation)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Model evaluation and data visualization

Each notebook focuses on both **theoretical concepts** and **practical implementations**, combining mathematical foundations with working Python code.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All notebooks are implemented using **Google Colab** or **Jupyter** for ease of access and testing.
- The lab files are independent but complementary, and together they form a solid base in AI fundamentals.
- Data used for testing is included where required (e.g., CSVs).

This repository serves as both a **learning resource** and a **reference toolkit** for those starting in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
